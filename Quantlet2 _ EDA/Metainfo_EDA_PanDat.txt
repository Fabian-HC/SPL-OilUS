Description: '
This quantlet applies various basic tools of exploratory data analysis 
(summary statistics and time series plots) to our data used for analysis 
of the driving forces of stock returns of 9 US companies of the nonrenewable energy sector. 
Note that this explorative approach helps to identify two companies differing from the other seven. 
The two companies produce electricity using nonrenewables. Since our topic of interest were the driving forces 
of the stock price of both oil and gas exploring, extracting and processing companies, 
we decided to treat the two deviating differently within the subsequent econometric analyses.

Summary statistics for 
(1) variables before application of transformations (computing logs, log-returns and z-scores)
(2) variables after the transformations have been applied

Plots
(1) Comparison of Stock performance from Q3 – 1996 until Q4 – 2015. Note that Q3 – 1996 is the base: Index = 100. 
(2) Plot of the evolvement of common factors, i.e. market variables: WTI Oil price, Gas price, Market (Dow Jones Index) and exchange rates of the USD with respect to: Euro, British Pound, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Russian Rouble, Indian Rupee, Brazilan Real. 
(3) Plots of dependent variable (Stock Price) and non-transformed enterprise-specific and shared variables by company. 
(4) Histograms of the distribution of the transformed specific variables by company. 
(5) Histograms of the common variables after the transformation has been applied. '
