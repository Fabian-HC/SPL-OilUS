Note that I used my initial plots of company-specific variables by company and common factors to come to my conclusions

The good news is: applying first differences to "Net Income" and "Book Value Equity / Market Capitalization" at least does 
away with almost all nonstationarity for "BC(EQ) / Macap". 

Yet, for net income, this is not the case!

And looking at the graphs, I have a suspicion why: the net income drops the most sharply for all problematic Companies at around 2013 / 2014, the period of the oil price collapse!!! 
Those are: +
(2) Apache, (5) Hess Corp, (6) Murphy Oil, (7) Occidental Petroleum

For Apache: the drop in Net Income is mirrored by a drop in BV(EQ) / MCAP and a rise in leverage (Debt / Equity)

For Hess Corp: The drop in Net income is mirrored by a rise in BV(EQ) / MCAP

For Murphy Oil: The substantial drop in Net income is mirrored by a rise in: Assets / MCAP, Debt/Equity, and BV(EQ) / MCAP

Occidental Petroleum: Interestingly enough, the drop in Net Income is not that substantially mirrored by other variables


My conclusion: Maybe panel data models (by requiring stationary variables or their transformations) are not flexible enough to accomodate the strong price variabtion of Oil in 2013-2015. Which would be a shame. The method of the authors might not be flexible enough
