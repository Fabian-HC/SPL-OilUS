Name of Quantlet: EDA_PanDat

Description: 
This quantlet applies various basic tools of exploratory data analysis to our data used for analysis of the driving forces of stock returns of 9 US companies of the nonrenewable energy sector. Note that this explorative approach helps to identify two companies differing from the other seven. One of the two companies is an investment fund and the other produces electricity using nonrenewables. 
Since our topic of interest were the driving forces of the oil price of both oil and gas exploring, extracting and processing companies, we decided to exclude the two deviating from the subsequent econometric analyses. 

Keywords: explorative data analysis, panel data, oil industry, US market, CAPM, Fama French related factors, summary statistics, graphs
