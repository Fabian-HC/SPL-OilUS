Hi Guys, 
you can subset the dataset according to dates (pre / post 2008) via
Pre2008 = subset(data, Date <= '2007-03-30')
Post2008 = subset(data, Date > '2007-03-30')
(got this from_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17708805/subset-data-frame-for-specific-dates) 
This general procedure can be found in our slides of day 2.
