Dear people, 

in this folder you will find the R code for how I managed (so far) transforming the initial dataset into one consisting of returns. 

Note that the returns are computed as: [P(t+1) - P(t)] / P(t). 
The computation of log-returns Ã  la ln[P(t+1) / P(t)] is a bit complicated because Net income takes on negative values and ln(-1000) returns a missing value. Does one of you have an idea how to fix that issue?

Can one of you do me the favor and check once more whether the values of my transformation in R match with the ones of the Excel table we relied on so far? 

Regards
Tim
