Description: '

This quantlet reads in the previously compiled dataset obtained from Bloomberg (or an alternative source providing the same financial
data). In a first step, the corresponding company names as well as more suitable shorthand variable names are added 
and the date variable is formatted adequately. Note that the panel data is NOT transformed into a pdata frame yet. 
This occurs only in the econometric analysis quantlets.


Before the data is transformed according to Bianconi and Yoshino (2014) , let us check whether the panel data set is stationary
according to the purtest() contained in the plm package. Since one can suspect nonstationarity 
to be more relevant for some variables (and their respective transformations), 
it is worthwhile to carry out the ADF-test and the KPSS-test (both of the plm package as well) 
per company and variable. All tests point to that the variables in our panel are nonstationarity. 

Keeping the results of this quantlet in mind, one can then proceed to the explorative data analysis quantlet, 
EDA_PanDat or the regression analyses quantlets (Quantlet 3_PanelDataAnalysis, Quantlet 4_TimeSeriesAnalysis). 

Transformations of variables applied
(1) Taking logs: Debt over Equity (D-MCAP), Assets over Market Cap (A-MCAP)
(2) Deriving log returns: Stock Prices, Exchange rates, Oil Price, Gas Price, 
(3) Variable standardization by company: Net Income (NI) and Book Value of Equity over its market value (BVE-MCAP)

Note that the fist and the last transformation, by just demeaning and scaling the variables are suspected to not remove the potential nonstationarity of these variables.

Please note that, according to Phillips and Moon (2000), nonstationarity in panel data 
might affect panel data regression procedures less if the panel dimensions (time and individuals) grow larger. 
Yet since the sample of this analysis is only (N=7 (9) and T = 80), nonstationary variables 
might still adversely affect the regression results.'
