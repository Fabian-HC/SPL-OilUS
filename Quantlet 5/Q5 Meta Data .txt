Name of Quantlet: Analysis of differences between subsamples Published in: Statistical Programming Languages Seminar 2016; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair of Statistics, Humboldt University of BerlinDescription: This Quantlet explore our panel by subsetting part of our data to look at structural breaks and differences between the type of firms. We adopte the approach used by Martin Boyey et Didier Fillon in « Common and Fundamental Factors in Stock Returns of Canadian Oil and Gas Companies ». First, we devide our data set in several subsamble (Ex Pre 2008 crisis, Post 2008 crisis) and run a regression for each subsamples with log return of stock price as dependent variable and the common factor as independent variable. Second we test for the signifiance of the difference between the coefficient of our previous regressions with the help of dummy variables. We study in this way the structural break due to the 2008 Crisis, the Seasonality and the difference of coefficient between Oil producers Firm and Electricity PoducersKeywords : Dummy variables, Panel data, 2008 crisis, Random model, Structural Break Keywords: explorative data analysis, panel data, oil industry, US market, CAPM, Fama French related factors, summary statistics, graphsAuthor: Antton HaramboureInput files: RegressionBase.RDataOutput:Results of the following regressions : - Oneway (individual) Random Effect for subsample Pre 2008 Crisis- Oneway (individual) Random Effect for subsample post 2008 Crisis- Oneway (individual) Random Effect with dummy post 2008 Crisis = 1- Oneway (individual) Random Effect with dummy for Quarter (base category Q1)- Oneway (individual) Random Effect for subsample of 7 oil-producing company- Oneway (individual) Random Effect for subsample of 2 Energy companies which - Oneway (individual) Random Effect with dummy Other than petrol = 1
