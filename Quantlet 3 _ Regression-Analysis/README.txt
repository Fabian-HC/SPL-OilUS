Description: 

This quantlet reads in the previously compiled dataset with transformed variables and first of all excludes two electricity companies that do not fit into the sample of oil companies. After having classified the dataset as panel data, fixed effects and random effects model regressions are applied and compared by the Hausman test. Further tests for heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and cross-sectional dependence are implemented and being used to get robust regression results. Outputs of regressions are generated for LATEX.
